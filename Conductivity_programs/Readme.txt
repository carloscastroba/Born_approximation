Born approximation for conductivity in Julia

Please check that you have installed the required packages and revise the paths
in the programs. 

The list of programs for the Born approximation are:
* Born_ap_cond_ex1_disc.jl     (piecewise conductivity)
* Born_ap_cond_ex2_smooth.jl  (smooth conductivity)

The list of programs for the iterative algorithm are:
* Iterative_method_cond_smooth.jl (compute the different iterations for smooth conductivity)
* Iterative_method_cond_linear.jl (compute the different iterations for linear conductivity)
* Figure_iter_cond.jl (From the data files created by the previous two programs 
  generates graphics with an error comparison)
